# Primes Service

This repository is meant to be a programming challenge.

Given 2 numbers, a start value and an end value, calculate all the possible prime numbers between them.

This code puzzle contains a basic interface.

You should:

* Implement the interface.
* Author a unit test that covers code all paths. That is; its test methods will assert proper and accurate functioning of the implementation and verify that exceptional behavior is handled appropriately (in a manner that does not crash the program).

Bonus points for authoring a Mock test that covers the Controller implementation.
